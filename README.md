# Password Generator

## What I did
To create a password generator, I did the following:

* I created a list of potential characters to include in a password generator that comprised of lower and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

* Next I asked the user how many characters would they like their new password to be, from 8 characters to 128.

* I then created a few prompts to ask the user what type of characters would they like to include in their new passwords.  The prompts inquired about the different types of characters mentioned above.

* To then see how many acceptable characters I had at my disposal, I concatinated all of the separate strings into one larger string of 93 characters.
