# Password Generator

## What I did
To create a password generator, I did the following:

* I created a list of potential characters to include in a password generator that comprised of lower and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

* Next I asked the user how many characters would they like their new password to be, from 8 characters to 128.

* I then created a few prompts to ask the user what type of characters would they like to include in their new passwords.  The prompts inquired about the different types of characters mentioned above.

* Then I created empty arrays for the new password and the random sets of characters to fill in.

*  Next, I added a counter to tally the number of characters the user needs to have of each of the minor strings (validation).

* I created if/then statements to concatinate the sets of minor strings that the user wants to include in their password and then added the tally for each of the minor strings to pull from.

* I had to check my work so I added in some console logs to see how things were doing.

* It was also necessary to add in some errors for when the user doesn't choose any of the character types (minor strings).

* Finally, I added the functions.  I still need LOTS of clarity on these.

## How does the application work

1. Click the Generate Password button.

2. Select how many characters you want for a password.

3. Choose which character types you want to include: letters (lower and upper case), numbers, and special characters.

4. Your new password will popup in the prompt area on the page.
